# Title: "Diabetes Readmission Prediction -Data Analysis "   The dataset used is from UCI Machine learning website and represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 U.S. hospitals. It contains over 50 (33 character and 17 numeric) variables with attributes such as patient number, demographic characteristics, various type of hospital visits, length of stay, diabetic medications, number of outpatient, inpatient, emergency visits, medications administered and readmitted status. We have trained and tested a range of models to identify the best performing model. I used Decision tress, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to discover key factors that explain readmission are number of lab procedures, number of impatient visits, number of medications, time spent in hospital and discharge disposition id.  The results obtained by random forest and decision tree on the actual imbalanced data
